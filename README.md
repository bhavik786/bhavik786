# 🤖 Bhavik Gevariya – From Curiosity to Code

Once a curious kid from Surat who broke apart gadgets to see how they worked, now an engineer in Toronto writing scalable, maintainable code that powers real-world applications.

Today, I build products that turn complexity into clarity, powered by **JavaScript, Python, and cloud-native tech**.  
Tomorrow, I’ll still be building — just better, faster, and smarter.

## 🚀 Who I Am (Without Buzzwords)

I don’t call myself a “ninja,” “rockstar,” or “10x dev.”  
I’m Bhavik — a builder of clean code, committed systems, and silent fixes that make apps smoother without anyone noticing.

- 🎓 **Master of Applied Computing**, University of Windsor  
- 🧠 4+ years of professional dev work  
- 🌍 Lived the grind in India, polished the craft in Canada

From Laravel spaghetti to NodeJS elegance — performance up by 20%, insights up by 40%.

## 🙊 Dev Confession Corner

- I’ve Googled “how to center a div” more times than I’m proud of.  
- I once fixed a bug by deleting and rewriting the same code. It worked.   
- I treat console.logs like diary entries.
  
## 💡 Stuff I Want to Build (But No One Asked For)

- 🎯 **StackOverflow Roulette** – You click a button, get a random (possibly incorrect) answer. Use at your own risk  
- 🔕 **NotAnotherNotification** – A Chrome extension that closes all tabs except the one you should be working on  
- 📸 **GitHub Selfie Camera** – Takes a photo of your face every time your build breaks 😭  
- 📦 **npm install life** – It does nothing. But imagine if it could fix everything.

Let’s break.  
Let’s ship.  
And let’s keep it real.
